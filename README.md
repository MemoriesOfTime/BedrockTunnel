## 🛠️ Build

Build the project:

```powershell
./gradlew build
```

Create the fat jar explicitly:

```powershell
./gradlew shadowJar
```

Create a Windows app image with a bundled runtime:

```powershell
./gradlew.bat packageAppImage
```

The runnable jar is written to:

- `build/libs/BedrockTunnel.jar`

The Windows app image is written to:

- `build/packaging/app-image/BedrockTunnel/`
- `build/packaging/app-image/BedrockTunnel/BedrockTunnel.exe`

## ▶️ Run

Run from Gradle:

```powershell
./gradlew run
```

Run the fat jar directly:

```powershell
java -jar build/libs/BedrockTunnel.jar
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Start BedrockTunnel.
2. Enter the local listen host and port.
3. Enter the target Bedrock server host and port.
4. Select the Bedrock protocol version.
5. Click `Start`.
6. Point the Bedrock client to the local listen address instead of the real server.

## 🖥️ Interface Overview

- Top bar: tunnel settings and live controls
- Center: packet list on the left and packet details on the right
- Bottom tabs: rules, statistics, and capture history

## 🔍 Packet Views

- `Summary`: packet metadata and current state
- `JSON`: serialized packet content
- `Hex`: raw packet bytes

## 🧰 Filtering

You can filter the packet list by:

- Direction
- State
- Packet type
- Keyword

Keyword matching checks packet names, summary text, JSON text, and hex text.

## 🚦 Rules And Breakpoints

- Blocking rules can work in `BLACKLIST` or `WHITELIST` mode
- Rules currently match by direction and packet type
- `Hide` rules remove matching packets from the packet list without affecting forwarding
- Breakpoints pause live traffic when a matching packet appears
- `Block` rules stop matching packets from being forwarded
- While paused, you can forward or drop the breakpoint packet, then resume queued traffic

## 🔁 Replay

- Replay is available in live mode
- It resends the selected captured packet with its original direction
- Packet editing is not included yet
- Offline history replay is not included yet

## 📊 Statistics

The `Stats` tab shows:

- Total packet count
- Total byte count
- Total replay count
- Breakpoint hit count
- Per-packet-type counters

## 🗂️ Capture History

Captured sessions are saved locally and can be reopened from the `History` tab for browsing, filtering, and reviewing packet details later.
